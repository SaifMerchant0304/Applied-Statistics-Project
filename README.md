_**Applied Statistics Project Overview: Leveraging Statistical Analysis in Sports and Startup Ecosystems**_

**Introduction**:
In this project, we utilize applied statistics methodologies to extract meaningful insights and support decision-making in two diverse domains: sports management and the startup ecosystem. Through rigorous statistical analysis, visualization, and hypothesis testing, we aim to address industry-specific challenges and provide actionable recommendations.

* **Part A : Basic Statistical Questions and Answers;**

* **Part B: Sports Domain Analysis:**
In the sports domain, specifically focusing on men's professional basketball, our objective is to analyze historical tournament data to identify top-performing teams for potential investment opportunities. The dataset "Basketball.csv" provides comprehensive information on teams' performance metrics, tournament participation, and achievements. Our analysis involves assessing teams' scoring patterns, tournament successes, and overall performance trends.

Key Steps:

* Data Exploration: We explore the dataset to understand its structure and variables, including team names, tournament history, and performance metrics.
* Statistical Analysis: Using descriptive statistics, we analyze teams' scoring, wins, losses, and tournament achievements. * This helps identify trends and patterns in team performance.
* Visualization: Through plotting distributions and visualizing key performance metrics, such as baskets scored, tournament victories, and highest positions held, we gain insights into teams' relative strengths.
* Hypothesis Testing: We formulate hypotheses to compare the performance of different teams based on selected criteria, such as tournament championships or winning streaks.


* **Part C: Startup Ecosystem Analysis:**
In the startup ecosystem domain, focusing on EU-based startups, our objective is to analyze company data from the "CompanyX_EU.csv" dataset. This dataset contains information on startup companies, their products, funding, participation in events like Startup Battlefield, and current operating status. Our analysis aims to uncover insights into startup performance, funding trends, and event participation outcomes.

Key Steps:

* Data Exploration: We explore the dataset to understand startup characteristics, funding levels, event participation, and operating states.
* Statistical Analysis: Utilizing statistical techniques, we analyze funding distributions, event outcomes, and operating states to identify trends and patterns.
* Visualization: Through visualization techniques such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, we visualize funding distributions, event participation, and startup success metrics.
* Hypothesis Testing: We formulate hypotheses to compare startup performance based on funding levels, event participation, and operating states, enabling data-driven decision-making.


**Conclusion:**
This project demonstrates the application of statistical analysis in diverse domains, including sports management and the startup ecosystem. By leveraging statistical techniques, visualization, and hypothesis testing, we provide valuable insights into team performance in professional basketball and startup success metrics. The findings from this analysis can inform strategic decisions, such as team investments in the sports industry or venture capital funding in the startup ecosystem.
